## Converting Roman to Integer Program

This Python program converts a Roman numeral string to an integer. It iterates through the Roman numeral characters in reverse, assigning their numeric values to 'num'. If 'num' is less than four times the accumulated value 'ans', it implies a subtraction case (e.g., IV for 4). In such cases, 'num' is subtracted from 'ans'; otherwise, 'num' is added to 'ans'. The final accumulated value is returned.
